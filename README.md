# The HTML/CSS test
We would like to ask you to build a fairly standard webpage using HTML and CSS. No javascript.

Take a look at the image supplied "Dev-design task". It's supplied in PNG as well as photoshop
format. If you do not have access to photoshop, please use the PNG image.

The basic assets are supplied as well.

We ask you to build a webpage that is similar to the supplied image, using only HTML, CSS and the supplied assets.

The ideal solution will be standards compliant and render correctly in all major browsers (IE11, Firefox, Safari and Chrome). It will look exactly as the image on a sufficiently large browser.

If you feel up to the task, we would also welcome a solution that's responsive and reflows all
elements according to the size of the browser down to smartphone size.

## Notes
Just clone it and:
```
$ npm install
...
$ npm start
```

And point your browser to [http://localhost:3000][1].

* I don't have Photoshop at the moment.
* I didn't make it responsive.
